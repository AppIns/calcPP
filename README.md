## calc++

#### Why?
It is exceptionally useful for calculations with tons of variables, (say a grade or a gpa) and is open source

#### How do I use it
Just enter a number and hit enter to add it to the "Stack"
###### (It's just a vector)

So far there is `1` command

| Command | Shortcut | Function |
|---------|----------|----------|
| `ADD` | `+` | Take the sum of every number |

#### One more thing
All commands will overwrite the vector by default. Add `_` add the end of a command (say `add_`) to disable this
