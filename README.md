## calc++

#### Why?
It is exceptionally useful for calculations with tons of variables, (say a grade or a gpa) and is open source

#### Example use:
```




```

#### How do I use it?

You might have an executable for your system just open that

If not, type `make` in the main directory

Just enter a number and hit enter to add it to the "Stack"

###### (It's just a vector)

So far there are `2` commands

| Command | Shortcut | Function |
|---------|----------|----------|
| `ADD` | `+` | Take the sum of every number |
| `MUL` | `*` | Take the product of every number |

#### One more thing
All commands will overwrite the vector by default. Add `_` add the end of a command (say `add_`) to disable this
